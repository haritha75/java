Cyclic Inheritance :

   -> In java cyclic inheritance does not allowed if a class,be inner or outer, attempts to inherits from itself.
   -> Simply cyclic inheritance means a class  inherits itself.
   -> Cyclic inheritance is absurd conceptually because it implies that a class is its superclass and sbclass at  the same time.
