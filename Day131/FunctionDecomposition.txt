Function Decomposition:

       -> It means diving a complex program into subroutines is called functional decomposition.
       -> Some times, your program becomes more complex if you diving  that code into number of methods then your code become easy to understand and more readable.

       1) Solving complex tasks:
        
             -> if you have complex problem then diving into the number of pieces that pieces are called methods.
             -> And also you can reuse some operations also.
             -> And also code become more readable using function decomposition.

        2) Decomposing a program into methods:    

              -> Functional decomposition is simply a process of decomposing a problem into several functions  or methods.
              -> Each method does a particular task so that we can perform these methods in a rpw tp get the result.
              -> Think which action we need to reuse multiple times,perform seperately.This is how we get desired methods.
              -> These methods are easy to read,understand,reuse,test and debug.

        3) Adding New Features:

               -> if you want to add another action,then we have to do is define the method with  action.
               -> And also if you have any changes on code then you can modify adding new things also.

 Advantages:

             -> It make changes easily.
             -> Test methods seperately.
             -> It Makes your code more readable.
             -> And also resue the code multiple times.
