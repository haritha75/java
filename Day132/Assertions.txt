Assertions :

      -> It mainly used to detect the bugs by testing code.
      -> Assertions allows testing the correctness of any ansumptions that have been made in the program.
      -> An Assertions is achieved using the assert keyword statement in java.
      -> while excuting assertion, it is believed to be true.
      -> If it fails, then jvm will throws an error named AssertionError.
      -> Mainly used for testing purpose during developement.
      -> assert statement is used with a boolean expression.
      -> Assertions are generally diabled at run time.
      -> It is used in the levels of testing and debugging not used in deployment level.

Advantages :

     -> Quick and efficient for detecting and correcting bugs.
     -> Assertion checks are done only during development and testing.Automatically removed in the production code or deployment level at run time so that it  wonnot slow the execution of the program.
     -> It helps remove boilerplate code and make code more readable.
