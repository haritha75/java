Stream.Of() : 

           -> It returns a sequencial ordered stream.
           -> This method calls the Arrays.stream() method for non-primitive  types like strings.
           -> It returns the Stream or generic stream of type T.that means ic can be used any type.
           -> It is used to converting non-primitive datatype arrays into streams for this purpose you are using this method.


Arrays.Steam() :

           -> It is used for processing of streams of primitive types are their primitive streams types.
           -> It returns IntStream,LongStream and DoubleStream.
           -> It only works int[],long[] and double[] type.remaining promitive types its not work.
           -> It is also returns the data sequentially.
