Intermediate Operations :

             -> Some operations produce another stream as result called Intermediate Operations.
             -> they can be chained together to form a pipeline of operations.
             -> pipeline of operations may contain any number of intermediate operations.
             -> They donot produce end result.
             -> This are lazily loaded.  
             -> Example : map(),filter(),sorted(),limit() etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 loaded.

Terminal Operations : 

            -> Some operations produce non-stream as result like collection or return nothing are called Terminal Operations. 
            -> It cannot be chained together.      
            -> In pipeline only one terminal operations contain that too at the end of pipeline.      
            -> They produce end result. 
            -> This are eagerly loaded.
            -> Example : forEach(),reduce(),collect() etc.
