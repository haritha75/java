*In Java, the main method serves as the entry point for the program. It is a special method that is called by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to start the execution of the program.

*Doc type comments, also known as documentation comments or Javadoc comments in Java, are a way to provide detailed documentation for classes, methods, and other program elements. These comments are used to generate API documentation using tools like Javadoc.

*However, the main method is not typically intended to be part of the API documentation. It is a static method defined in a class, and its purpose is to execute the program logic. It doesn't represent a reusable component or an externally accessible part of the codebase.

*Since the main method is not typically documented for external users or developers, there is no strict requirement to include doc type comments specifically for the main method. Instead, the focus of documentation in Java is typically on the classes, interfaces, methods, and other API elements that are intended for reuse and interaction with other parts of the codebase.

*while doc type comments are not commonly used in the main method in Java because it is not part of the API documentation, it's still advisable to include regular comments(single line and double line comments) to enhance code clarity and maintainability.
