LinkedList class:

    --> Linked List like a array list but linked list accepts all type of datatype at a time but not array list.
    --> Liked list is a dynamic array so easy to deleting and inserting elements in array.
    --> We donot want specify the size while creating the array.it automatically increases and decreases.

Advantages of LinkedList:

     1. Dynamic size.
     2. Easy to Inserting and Deleting elements in Array.
     3.Flexible Iteration.


Disadvantages of LinkedList:

     1. Slower performance compared to arrayList.
     2. It requires more memory.


Differences between ArrayList and LinkedList:

           ArrayList                                                                    LinkedList
    
    1. This class uses a dynamic array to                                    This class uses a double linked list  to                                    
        to store elements in it.                                                to store elements in it.
       
    2. Inefficient memory utilization.                                        Good memory utilization.

    3. It can be one, two or multi-                                           It can either single double or circular linked   
        Dimentional.                                                            list.

    4. Insertion operation slower.                                            Insertion operation is fast.

    5. It implements a list interface.                                        It implements both list and deque interfaces.

    6. Data access and storage is very efficient.                             Data access and storage is not efficient.

    7. Deletion operation is not efficient.                                   Deletion operation is efficient.

    8. It stores similar datatypes only.                                      It stores multiple datatypes.

    9. Less memory is used.                                                   More memeory is used.

    10. It is a static memeory allocation.                                    It is a Dynamic memeroy allocation.
