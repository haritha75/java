GarbageCollector :

             -> Garbage Collector in java is the automated process of deleting code that's no longer needed or used.
             -> This automatically frees up memory space and ideally makes coding java apps easier for developers.
             -> When java programs run on the jvm,objects  are created on the heap, which is a portion of memory dedicated to the program.
             -> Eventually, some objects will no longer be needed.
             -> The garbabge collector finds these unused objects and deletes then to free up memory.
             -> The main main objective of garbage collector is to free heap memory by destryoing unreachable objects(like assigning null).

How does Garbage collector works in java :
                 
            -> java garbage collection is an automatic  process.
            -> Automatic garbage collection is the process of looking at heap memeory,identifying which objects are in use and which object are not in use, 
                 and deleting the unused objects from the memory.The main advantage of java garbage collector is  automatically removes unused objects.
