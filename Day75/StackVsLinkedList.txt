Stack :
  
  Stack is linear data structure that is used to store the collections object.
  It based on last-in-first-out.Stack extends the vector class.
  It implements interface list,colllection,iterable,


Advantages of Stack:
   

   1. Memory efficiency.
   2. Easy access.
   3. Global Accessibility means it access anywhere.

Disadvantages of Stack:

   
   1. Difficult to test.
   2. Limited Flexibility.
   3. Difficulty in extension.

Applications of Stack in real life:
   

   1. CD/DVD stand.
   2. Stack of books in book shop.
   3. Call center Systems.
   4. Web brower history.
   5. Youtube downloads and notifications.
   6.Google photos and e-mails in any gallery also stored form of stack.
   7. In cards also stack form.




LinkedList:


   It stores multiples datatypes at a time.
   It does not stored in contiguous locations.
   It also stored address of next node.



Advantages of LinkedList:      


     1. Dynamic size.
     2. Easy to Inserting and Deleting elements in Array.
     3. Flexible Iteration.


Disadvantages of LinkedList:

     1. Slower performance compared to array.
     2. It requires more memory.


Differences between Stack and LinkedList;

                    Stack                                                  LinkedList


         1. It can read topmost element.                         It is required to traverse though each element 
                                                                  to access a specific eleemnt.

         2. It follows LIFO.                                     Elements connect to each other ny references.

         3. Simpler than linked list.                            More complex than stack.

         4. It is a abstrack datatype it servers with two        It is a linear collection of data elements whose order
             pricipal operations which is push and pop.             is not given by their location i memory.

         5. Main operations are push,pop,peek.                   In linked list main operations are insert,delete and traversing.    

         6. It takes less time to perform operations.            It takes more time compared to stack.
