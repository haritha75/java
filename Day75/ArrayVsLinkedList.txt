Array:
   
   Array store elements contiguous memory locations.
   It allows faster access to an element at a specific index.
   It can store same datatypes ata time.

LinkedList:


   It stores multiples datatypes at a time.
   It does not stored in contiguous locations.
   It also stored address of next node.


Advantages of Arrays:

   1. It stores multiple data of similar types with the same name.
   2. It allows random access to elements.
   3. There is memory shortage or overflow because its size is fixed.
   4. Itnis easy to iterate the elements.

Disadvatages of Arrays:


   1. Array is static does not changed.
   2. Insertion and  deletion operations are difficult.
   3. If array size is big then memory will be wastage.



Advantages of LinkedList:      


     1. Dynamic size.
     2. Easy to Inserting and Deleting elements in Array.
     3. Flexible Iteration.


Disadvantages of LinkedList:

     1. Slower performance compared to array.
     2. It requires more memory.


Differences between Array and LinkedList:
     

        Array                                                          LinkedList


    1. Array is stored in contiguous locations.                  It does not stored on contiguous locations.

    2. Fixed in size.                                            Dynamic in size.

    3. Memory allocated at compile time.                         Memory allocated at run time.

    4. Elements accessed easily.                                 Elements accessing requires the traversal of whole linkedlist.

    5. Insertion and deletion operation takes time.              Insertion and deletion operation is fast.
