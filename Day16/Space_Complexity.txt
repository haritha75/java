//write about space complexity and it's types.

SPACE COMPLEXITY: It measures total amount of memory that an  algorithm needs to run according to its input size.

TYPES:
1)CONSTANT SPACE COMPLEXITY:It takes the same amount of space regardless of the input size.it repsented as O(1).

2)LINEAR SPACE COMPLEXITY:It takes space directly proportional to the input size.it represented as O(n).

3)POLYNOMIAL SPACE COMPLEXITY:Space complexity grows proportionally to the square of the input size.it represented as O(n^2).
