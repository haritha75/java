MultiThreading: 
  
        -> MultiThreading in java is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously.
        -> Thread is lightweight-sub process, the smallest unit of processing.
        -> It can handle multiple requests from the same user.
        -> Threads can created by using two ways:
           1) Extending the Thread class.
           2) Implementing the runnable interface.


  1) Thread creaation by extending the thread class:

       -> We create a class that class extends the thread class and overrides the threads class method in this class.
       -> We create object  to the class and call the start method whenever call the start method to start the exectuion of a thread.
       -> start() methods invoke the run() method on the thread object.

  2) Thread creation by implementing the runnable interface:

       -> We create a class and implementing the runnable interface and overrides run() method. Then we instantiate a thread object and call start()
           method on this object.
