//here system.out.println nothing but system is class and out is a global variable means public static int out like this and last one println is a  public static method.that why we are printing with out object.this all are static so we are printing with the help of system class.

public class SOPLine {

    public static void main(String[] args) {


        int a=0;

        System.out.println(a);
    }
    
}
