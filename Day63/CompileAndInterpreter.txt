Compile:
   
   -> it converts a program into machine code as whole. 
   -> it create object code file.
   -> Compiler takes entire program as input.
   -> Program need not be compiled every time.
   -> Errors are displayed after entire program is checked.


                               compiler
              source code -------------------->   byte code





Interpreter:

   -> it converts a program into machine code statement by statement.
   -> it does not create object code file.
   -> Interpreter takes single instrctions as input.
   -> every time higer level programs is comverted into lower level program.
   -> errors are displayed for every instrction interpreter.
