Vector class: 

       --> Vector implements a dynamic array which means it can grow or shrink as required. 

       --> Like an array, it contains components that can be accessed using an integer index.

       --> They are very similar to ArrayList, but Vector is synchronized and has some legacy methods that the collection framework does not contain.



Advantages of Vector:


-> Synchronization
-> Dynamic size
-> Legacy support


Disadvantages of Vector:


-> slower performance compared to other collection classes.



Difference between ArrayList and Vector:


                    ArrayList                                                               Vector

1. ArrayList is not synchronized.	                                        Vector is synchronized.

2. ArrayList increments 50% of the current array size                           Vector increments 100% means doubles the array size
    if the number of elements exceeds ts capacity.	                          if the total number of elements exceeds its capacity.

3. ArrayList is not a legacy class. It is introduced in JDK 1.2.	        Vector is a legacy class.

4. ArrayList is fast because it is non-synchronized.	                        Vector is slow because it is synchronized

5. ArrayList performance is high 	                                        Vector performance is low 

6. Multiple threads is allowed 	                                                Only one threads are allowed .
