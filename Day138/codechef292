Object and Array Mutability with const

Consider the following code snippet:

const userProfile = { name: "Alex", status: "active" };
userProfile.status = "inactive";

const tags = ["dev", "js"];
tags.push("es6");


Correct Answer:
Both the status update (mutation) and adding a tag (mutation) are allowed because const only prevents reassigning the variable itself to a completely new object or array.
Explanation:

When you use const, you canâ€™t change the whole variable (like assign a new object or array),
but you can change the inside of that object or array (like update a property or add an item).
So updating userProfile.status and pushing to tags is totally okay!
