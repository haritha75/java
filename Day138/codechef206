What is the output of the following code?

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(7.0 / 2);
    }
}


Correct Answer:
3.5
Explanation:

When dividing a decimal value by an integer the result is a decimal value. As 7.0 is a decimal value the result will be 3.5, if the value would have been 7(integer value) the result would be 3.
