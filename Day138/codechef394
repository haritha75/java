An airport announcement system needs to display different types of flight alerts. The developer is defining identifiers for class names and method names but accidentally uses an invalid identifier.

class FlightAlerts {
    public static void flightOnTime() { }
    public static void flightDelayed() { }
    public static void flight-cancelled() { }
}


Correct Answer:
flight-cancelled
Explanation:

flightOnTime
Incorrect because it follows Java naming rules for method identifiers.

flightDelayed
Incorrect because it is a valid method name without special characters.

flight-cancelled
Correct because hyphens (-) are not allowed in Java identifiers.

FlightAlerts
Incorrect because it is a valid class name, not a method name.
