To print "Java" and "Programming" on the same line with a space in between, you would write:

Correct Answer:
System.out.println("Java  " + "Programming");
Explanation:

System.out.println("JavaProgramming");: This option would print "JavaProgramming" without any space between "Java" and "Programming".

System.out.println("Java " + "Programming");: This option correctly uses string concatenation with the plus operator to print "Java" and "Programming" with a space in between.

System.out.println("Java" + "Programming");: Similar to the first option, this option would print "JavaProgramming" without any space between "Java" and "Programming".

System.out.println("Java" + "\n" + "Programming");: This option would print "Java" and "Programming" on separate lines due to the newline character "\n" between them.

So, the correct option to print "Java" and "Programming" on the same line with a space in between is option 2: System.out.println("Java " + "Programming");.
