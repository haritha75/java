Problem (Make Avg) - Generate examples

Now that we have understood the problem statement, let us write down a few more sample cases or examples. Review the sample input / output given in the table below.

Correct Answer(s):
For A = 3 and C = 4, the output is -1
For A = 3 and C = 5, the output is 4
For A = 2 and C = 4, the output is 3
Explanation:

For A = 3 and C = 4, the output is -1 as the average of 3 and 4 cannot be an integer.    
        
For A = 3 and C = 5, the output is 4 as the average of 3 and 5 is 4 - which is an integer.    
    
For A = 2 and C = 4, the output is 3 as the average of 2 nd 4 is 3 - which is an integer.
