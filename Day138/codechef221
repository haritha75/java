What will be the output of the following code?

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = 5, y = 5;
    if (x > y)
      System.out.println("x is greater");
    else if (y >= x)
      System.out.println("y is greater");
    else
      System.out.println("Both are equal");
  }
}


Correct Answer:
y is greater
Explanation:

The code compares x and y and prints the second message since the comparison result is true and does not execute the next else condition
