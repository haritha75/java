Variable Scope and Mutation

What will be logged to the console by the following code?

const config = { id: 1 };

config.id = 2;
if (true) {
  const config = { id: 3 }; 
  config.id = 4;
  console.log("Inside block:", config.id);
}

console.log("Outside block:", config.id);


Correct Answer:
Inside block: 4
Outside block: 2
Explanation:

The outer config is a constant object, and we can change its properties, so config.id = 2 works fine.
Inside the if block, a new config variable is declared (block-scoped), which is separate from the outer one.
So, Inside block: 4 and Outside block: 2 are printed â€” no error occurs.
