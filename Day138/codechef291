Mutability of const Arrays

const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

colors[1] = "yellow";        
colors.push("orange");       
colors = ["pink", "white"];  


Correct Answer:
Reassigning the entire array using colors = ["pink", "white"] will throw an error
Explanation:

When an array is declared using const, the reference to the array cannot change, but the contents of the array can still be modified.
- colors[1] = "yellow" modifies an existing element — this is allowed.
- colors.push("orange") adds a new element to the array — this is also allowed.
- colors = ["pink", "white"] tries to assign a new array to the variable colors, which is not allowed because const prevents reassignment of the variable reference.
