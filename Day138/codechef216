What does the following code do?

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       int marks = 75;
       char grade;
       if (marks >= 60)
         grade = 'A';
       else
         grade = 'B';
    }
}


Correct Answer(s):
Assigns 'A' to grade if marks are greater than or equal to 60
Assigns 'B' to grade if marks are less than 60
Explanation:

The code assigns the grade 'A' if the marks are greater than or equal to 60, otherwise 'B' is assigned.
