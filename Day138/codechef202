What will the following code output?

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello " + "\n" + " World!");
    }
}

Correct Answer:
None of the above
Explanation:

"\n" moves to the next line, and " " acts as a space. So " World!" gives one character space before printing "World!".

Actual Output:
Hello
_World!

( _ : denotes empty space)
