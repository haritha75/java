HashMap:
 
    -> HashMap is class in java.
    -> It implements the map interface.
    -> It is used to store and retireve values based on the keys.
    -> It does not allows duplicates keys but it allows values.
    -> It allows null keys and null values.

Advatages of HashMap:

    1. Allows insetion of key value pair.
    2. It is a fall-fast iterator.
    3. Faster access of elements due to hashong technology.
    4. It is a non synchronized.

Disadvatages of HashMap:

      1. No guranted order.It print random order.
      2. Performance trade-off.
      3. Key uniqueness and null values.
      3. Memory overhead.


HashSet:

    -> HashSet is a class. in java.      
    -> It implementsthe set interface.
    -> It stores only keys not store values.
    -> It does not allows duplicates keys.

Advatages of HashSet:

    1. Unique keys.
    2. Constant Time operations.
    3. Flexible size.
    5. It is Fast Lookup.

Disadvatages of HashSet:

    1. Unordered Collection.
    2. No indexing.
    3. Perormance degrations.
    4. Overhead menas it contains more Memory.

Difference between HashMap and HashSet:

               HashMap                                                                     HashSet

    1. It designed to store key-value pairs.                                It designed to store collection of unique elements.

    2. Key must be unique.                                                  It does not allow duplicate values or keys.

    3. It ordering elements randomly.                                       It ordering elements specific order.

    4. It provides fast access to elment based on key.                      It offers faster lookup times for elment.

    5.It implement map interface.                                           It implements set interface.
